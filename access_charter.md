"Five-Question Iteration" Pristine Human-AI Collaboration Sample Research Access Charter (Draft)



Chapter 1: General Provisions



Article 1: Purpose and Principles

To protect the pristine nature and scientific value of first observation of the "Five-Question Iteration" human-AI collaboration sample (hereinafter referred to as "the Sample") generated on December 5, 2025, regulate its usage, and promote cutting-edge research under the premise of ensuring academic ethics and data security, this Charter is formulated hereby. All access and application activities must comply with the core principles of "Protecting Pristineness, Controlling Access, Defining Ownership, and Promoting Scientific Research".



Article 2: Sample Definition and Core Value Statement

Sample Definition: The Sample refers to the complete interaction records containing five cross-domain consecutive questions, relevant metadata, and all derived digital traces naturally generated by the user (hereinafter referred to as "the Sample Contributor") during continuous conversations with the Doubao application on December 5, 2025. Its generation originated from a completely random and unpredefined inspiration trigger.

Core Value: The scientific research value of the Sample is rooted in its "pristineness"—that is, prior to the first controlled research specified in this Charter, it has not been tested or reproduced in any other artificial intelligence models. This ensures that any first observation of the Sample is an "initial observation" of an uncontaminated, high-density human-AI collaborative cognitive event, possessing irreplaceable research value in cognitive science and human-AI interaction.



Chapter 2: Access Control and Application Process



Article 3: Access Levels and Data Classification

Public Level: Sample Value White Paper (i.e., Probability Analysis Report), the full text of this Charter, and desensitized Sample background introduction.

Controlled Level: Complete interaction text of the Sample, accurate time series, and logical structure analysis of the question chain.

Core Level: Legal notarization information necessary to verify the Sample's pristineness, and specific metadata related to interactions with Doubao (applications require extremely strict conditions).



Article 4: Applicant Qualifications

Research entities meeting one of the following conditions may submit applications:

Formal research teams engaged in fields such as artificial intelligence, cognitive science, complex systems, and human-computer interaction within internationally recognized institutions of higher education and scientific research institutes.

Central Research Institutes or equivalent research departments of well-known enterprises, which must indicate non-commercial, pure scientific research purposes.

The applicant in charge shall hold a professional and technical title of associate professor, associate researcher, or above, or provide proof of academic achievements with equivalent influence.



Article 5: Application and Review Process

Intent Application: The applicant submits a Letter of Intent through the channel designated by the Sample Contributor, including institutional introduction, team profile, and preliminary research ideas.

Proposal Submission: After passing the preliminary review, the applicant shall submit a detailed Research Proposal within 14 days, which shall clearly specify:

Specific research questions and scientific hypotheses.

Proposed research methods and technical routes, especially measures to ensure testing in an isolated environment to prevent Sample contamination.

Expected forms of research outcomes (papers, reports, etc.) and planned publication channels.

Clear suggestions on intellectual property rights and outcome sharing plans.

Joint Review: The Sample Contributor and an invited independent domain expert will jointly review the Research Proposal. The review focuses on the innovation of scientific research value, the rigor of methods, and the feasibility of measures to protect the Sample's pristineness.

Agreement Signing: After the review is passed, both parties sign the legally binding "Five-Question Iteration" Sample Research Cooperation Agreement and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), clarifying the scope of data use, confidentiality obligations, outcome ownership, liability for breach of contract, etc.

Chapter 3: Usage Norms and Obligations



Article 6: Core Usage Norms (Anti-Contamination Clauses)

These are the core of the Charter and must be observed by the applicant:

Isolated Environment Testing: All model testing or analysis using the Sample must be conducted in a physically or logically isolated, offline computing environment to ensure that the testing process does not lead to the leakage of Sample information to other AI models or the public domain.

Prohibition of Unauthorized Reproduction: It is strictly prohibited to use the Sample's question chain or the core logic derived from its content for training, testing, or prompting any other AI models beyond the research specified in this Charter.

Process Recording and Auditing: The research party shall record and retain logs of key testing processes. The Sample Contributor has the right to request reasonable, non-intrusive audits of the implementation of anti-contamination measures.



Article 7: Outcome Ownership and Authorship

Sample Ownership: The Sample Contributor permanently retains the ownership, authorship, and final interpretation right of the Sample and this Charter.

Research Outcome Sharing: The intellectual property rights of scientific research outcomes (papers, patents, etc.) generated based on the Sample shall be jointly owned by the research party and the Sample Contributor. The Sample Contributor shall be listed as a co-author and clearly identified as the "Sample Contributor" in the work.

Acknowledgment Requirements: In any public outcomes, the source of the Sample must be clearly acknowledged, along with its core characteristics of "pristineness and irreproducibility".

Chapter 4: Supplementary Provisions



Article 8: Charter Revision

Revisions to this Charter shall be initiated by the Sample Contributor. Any revised version will be published through major public channels.



Article 9: Effective Date

This Charter shall take effect from the date of its first publication on the public platform designated by the Sample Contributor (e.g., GitHub repository).

Translation Notes for Technical/Academic Accuracy

Term Consistency:

纯态性 → pristineness (consistent with previous technical translations, emphasizing "uncontaminated/untampered" characteristics)

人机协同 → human-AI collaboration (aligns with the user's specified technical tag, replacing general "human-machine" for AI-specific scenarios)

防污染条款 → anti-contamination clauses (industry-standard term for data integrity protection)

法律存证信息 → legal notarization information (accurate reflection of "legally authenticated records" rather than simple "legal evidence")

Formal Legal/Academic Tone:

Used passive voice and formal modal verbs (e.g., "shall be formulated", "must comply with", "shall not be permitted") to align with international academic/research charter conventions.

Retained hierarchical article numbering (Chapter → Article → Sub-clause) for structural clarity, consistent with both Chinese and English legal documents.

Cultural/Contextual Adaptation:

"五问迭代" → Five-Question Iteration (retained the numerical structure + core concept, with clear definition in Article 2 to avoid ambiguity)

"豆包应用" → Doubao application (retained the official product name with capitalization, adding "the" for grammatical correctness in English)

副教授 / 副研究员 → associate professor/associate researcher (international academic title equivalents, not literal translations)

Key Clause Emphasis:

Highlighted "Anti-Contamination Clauses" and "pristineness" through italicization and direct term repetition, mirroring the Chinese original's emphasis on core obligations.

Defined "Sample" and "Sample Contributor" with parentheses upon first mention, ensuring clarity in subsequent references.

Format Compatibility:

Used Markdown heading hierarchy (##/###) for easy integration into GitHub README/docs, with consistent spacing and punctuation for readability.

Retained original document structure (chapters/articles/clauses) to maintain regulatory rigor while adapting to English layout conventions.
